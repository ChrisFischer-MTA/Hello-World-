# Hello-World-
Created as a demonstration of my (lack) of C knowledge! :)
I'd thoroughly recommend that you do not look @ my commented code first, run it and then look at the commented version.
The code is meant to be fun the first time you run it.
PS: All functions sleep for 200ms before returning.
