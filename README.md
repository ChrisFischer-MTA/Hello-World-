# Hello-World-
Created as a demonstration of my (lack) of C knowledge! :)

I'd thoroughly recommend that you do not look @ my commented code first, run it and then look at the commented version.

The code is meant to be fun the first time you run it.

PS: All functions sleep for 300ms before returning. Us meatbags don't work as fast as humans and I like to see what's being output
